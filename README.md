# MoE on Multi-omics

Trials to use Mixture of Expert on Multi-omic features

Objective : Not only SOTA, but also Biologically & Clinically Explainable

### Consideration for loss as statistical approach

[for gate]

auxiliary loss

gate importance loss

gate entropy loss


[for feature]

triplet loss



[for representation]

Barlow twins loss

VICReg loss

### Consideration for gate structure

sigmoid

softmax

gumbel softmax

attentioned gate

gate for input feature vs hidden dimension

### Consideration for expert (+ transfer learning)

how many layer should be open / freeze



### Consideration for explainability
